## The semicolon problem

Apparently JavaScript automatically inserts semicolons in some cases.

The goal for this transpiler can be one of two:
1. Syntactical accuracy for theoretical correctness.
2. Minimal use of semicolons merely to ensure consistent behavior upon transpilation.

For now, I'm sticking with #2.
